# z-record-knowledge Implementation Profile

**Status:** Source package standardized. A target-platform pilot remains required before broader deployment.

## Identity and Ownership

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owner | ZedBiz |
| Canonical identifier | `z-record-knowledge` |
| Authoritative source | [z-record-knowledge-Skill](https://github.com/ZedBiz44/z-record-knowledge-Skill) |
| Runtime package | `dist/z-record-knowledge/` |

## Purpose and Scope

Create or improve durable evidence-backed knowledge records only when lasting capture is justified and authorized.

The skill must stay within the authorization conveyed by its invoking task. It does not grant access, approval, publication authority, or permission to alter unrelated systems.

## Platforms and Packaging

| Field | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Shared core | Codex, OpenClaw, and Hermes-compatible `SKILL.md` frontmatter with `name` and `description` only |
| Build command | `bash scripts/build_package.sh` |
| Structural validation | `python3 scripts/validate_skill.py dist/z-record-knowledge` |
| Regression check | `bash scripts/test_default_package_build.sh` |
| Pilot scope | One isolated or explicitly approved target environment before broader rollout |

## Operating Controls

Read credible sources and, when authorized, create, update, combine, route, or publish a durable knowledge record through the applicable specialist procedure.

Changes to the skill source, production deployment, privileges, secrets, or external integrations require the approval applicable to that environment. Do not treat this profile as a substitute for environment-specific authorization.

## Completion Evidence

| Pilot and trigger evidence | [Pilot and trigger-test record](pilot-test-record.md) |
| Release source | Git commit and deployment record |
